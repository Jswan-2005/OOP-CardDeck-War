# OOP-CardDeck-War
This is a OOP card deck which is then implemented into a card game called 'War'.
The rules of war are simple.
  1.  The game is played by two people
  2.  A deck (including jokers) is shuffled and split into two
  3.  Each player gets one half of the deck
  4.  Both players simultaneously flip the top card from their deck and place it face up
  5.  The player with the highest value card (Jokers are the highest) wins both cards
  6.  The winning player then takes both cards and places them into the bottom of their deck
  7.  If there is a tie (Both cards are of equal values) three more cards are wagered and placed face down and a new turn commences
This game is implemented using an 'AI' player versus a real user.
Enjoy!
